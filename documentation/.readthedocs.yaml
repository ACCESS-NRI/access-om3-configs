# (https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-Hive-Docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/check_links_workflow.yml)
# By default this uses the ACCESS-Hive-Docs lychee config (https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-Hive-Docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/lychee_config.toml)
# To use a custom lychee config, add `.github/workflows/lychee_config.toml` to this repo.
