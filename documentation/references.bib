              System Simulator coupled model, ACCESS-CM2, has been developed
              for a wide range of climate modelling research and applications.
              In particular, ACCESS-CM2 is one of Australia's contributions to
              the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model
              Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Compared with the
              ACCESS1.3 model used for our CMIP5 submission, all model
              components have been upgraded as well as the coupling framework
              (OASIS3-MCT) and experiment control system (Rose/Cylc). The
              component models are: UM10.6 GA7.1 for the atmosphere, CABLE2.5
              for the land surface, MOM5 for the ocean, and CICE5.1.2 for the
              sea ice. This paper describes the model configuration of
              ACCESS-CM2, documents the experimental set up, and assesses the
              model performance for the preindustrial spin-up simulation in
              comparison against (reconstructed) observations and ACCESS1.3
              results. While the performance of the two generations of the
              ACCESS coupled model is largely comparable, ACCESS-CM2 shows
              better global hydrological balance, more realistic ocean water
              properties (in terms of spatial distribution) and meridional
              overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean but a poorer
              simulation of the Antarctic sea ice and a larger energy imbalance
              at the top of atmosphere. This energy imbalance reflects a
              noticeable warming trend of the global ocean over the spin-up
              period.",

              (ACCESS) has been extended to include land and ocean carbon cycle
              components to form an Earth System Model (ESM). The current
              version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable
              Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
              Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the
              model components and changes to the previous version,
              ACCESS-ESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to
              highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon
              cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and
              small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC year−1
              for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of
              ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate
              system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and
              carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the
              CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and
              ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the
              climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the
              carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate
              response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an
              equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.87°C.",
