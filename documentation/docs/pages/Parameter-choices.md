## MOM6 parameter choices

### Horizontal grid

The 25km global configuration uses a tripolar grid to avoid a singularity at the North Pole. The domain is zonally periodic `REENTRANT_X = True` and open at the north via a tripolar fold `TRIPOLAR_N = True` while closed in the south `REENTRANT_Y = False`. The horizontal grid has `1440x1142` tracer points. This matches the resolution of prior models (eg, ACCESS-OM2-025 and GFDL OM4/OM5) and provides eddy-permitting detail in the ocean while maintaining numerical stability.

### Vertical resolution and ALE coordinate
The current configuration uses 75 vertical layers (`NK=75`) with an arbitrary Lagrangian Euler (`ALE`) vertical coordinate scheme. The ALE scheme is enabled by `USE_REGRIDDING = True` (activating the “split-explicit” layered/reegridding algorithm). Rather than fixed z-levels, MOM6 can operate in a hybrid vertical coordinate mode. The current configuration uses a stretched $z^*$ vertical coordinate `REGRIDDING_COORDINATE_MODE = "ZSTAR"`. The vertical grid spacing is specified via an input file (`ALE_COORDINATE_CONFIG = "FILE:ocean_vgrid.nc,interfaces=zeta"`). The deepest ocean depth is set to `MAXIMUM_DEPTH = 6000.0` and partial bottom cells are effectively used by `ALE`. Gravitational acceleration (`G_EARTH = 9.8`) and reference density (`RHO_0 = 1035`) are set to standard values, consistent with `BOUSSINESQ = True`. The Boussinesq setup means density variations only affect buoyancy, not total mass. In our configuration, sea level is computed assuming a reference density (here using the fixed reference density for sea-level calc since `CALC_RHO_FOR_SEA_LEVEL = False`).
