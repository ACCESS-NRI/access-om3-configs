## MOM6 parameter choices

### Horizontal grid

The 25km global configuration uses a tripolar grid to avoid a singularity at the North Pole. The domain is zonally periodic `REENTRANT_X = True` and open at the north via a tripolar fold `TRIPOLAR_N = True` while closed in the south `REENTRANT_Y = False`. The horizontal grid has `1440x1142` tracer points. This matches the resolution of prior models (eg, ACCESS-OM2-025 and GFDL OM4/OM5) and provides eddy-permitting detail in the ocean while maintaining numerical stability.

### Vertical resolution and ALE coordinate
The current configuration uses 75 vertical layers (`NK=75`) with an arbitrary Lagrangian Euler (`ALE`) vertical coordinate scheme. The ALE scheme is enabled by `USE_REGRIDDING = True` (activating the “split-explicit” layered/reegridding algorithm). Rather than fixed z-levels, MOM6 can operate in a hybrid vertical coordinate mode. The current configuration uses a stretched $z^*$ vertical coordinate `REGRIDDING_COORDINATE_MODE = "ZSTAR"`. The vertical grid spacing is specified via an input file (`ALE_COORDINATE_CONFIG = "FILE:ocean_vgrid.nc,interfaces=zeta"`). The deepest ocean depth is set to `MAXIMUM_DEPTH = 6000.0` and partial bottom cells are effectively used by `ALE`. Gravitational acceleration (`G_EARTH = 9.8`) and reference density (`RHO_0 = 1035`) are set to standard values, consistent with `BOUSSINESQ = True`. The Boussinesq setup means density variations only affect buoyancy, not total mass. In our configuration, sea level is computed assuming a reference density (here using the fixed reference density for sea-level calc since `CALC_RHO_FOR_SEA_LEVEL = False`).

### Thermodynamics and Equation of State (TEOS-10)
The current configuration uses `EQN_OF_STATE = "ROQUET_RHO"` for seawater, which refers to the polynomial fit of the `TEOS-10` equation of state by [@roquet2015accurate]. [`ROQUET_RHO`](<https://mom6.readthedocs.io/en/main/api/generated/pages/Equation_of_State.html#:~:text=in%20situ%20temperature).-,ROQUET_RHO%20Equation%20of%20State,-%C2%B6>) uses a 75-term polynomial to compute in-situ density as a function of conservative temperature and absolute salinity (`USE_CONTEMP_ABSSAL = True`), closely approximating the full TEOS-10 results. However, the cold-start initial conditions in our configuration use an inconsistent temperature–salinity pair - specifically, conservative temperature combined with practical salinity (see [issues/235](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues/235)). 

The `_RHO` variant specifically fits density rather than specific volume, ideal for layered models and ensuring that neutral density calculations are precise. The configuration also sets the freezing point formulation to `TFREEZE_FORM = "TEOS_POLY"`, indicating the model computes the seawater freezing temperature with a [TEOS-10](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/nwprod/hafs.v2.0.8/sorc/hafs_forecast.fd/MOM6-interface/MOM6/src/equation_of_state/_Equation_of_State.dox#:~:text=This%20one%20or%0ATEOS_poly%20must%20be%20used%20if%20you%20are%20using%20the%20ROQUET_RHO%2C%20ROQUET_SPV%20or%20TEOS%2D10%0Aequation%20of%20state.).

### Surface freezing and salinity constraints
At the ocean surface, we have enabled the realistic sea-ice formation and salinity. We've turned on frazil ice formation (`FRAZIL = TRUE`), which means if the ocean surface layer temperature drops below the freeziing point, the model will convert the negative heat content into frazil ice instead of allowing the water to supercool. By enabling frazil, any heat deficit below freezing in the ocean is passed to the ice component as latent heat of fusion, preventing unrealistically cold liquid water. 

We also ensure salinity never goes negative by setting `BOUND_SALINITY = True`. In coupled models, when sea ice forms or melts, large salinity fluxes occur. This switch prevents numerical issues when the top model cell might be depleted of salt by excessive ice formation. With this parameter on, salinity is clipped at a minimum value (`MIN_SALINITY = 0.0`). If the sea-ice model were to extract more salt than available, the ocean salinity will be floored at 0 and any deficit is ignored, avoiding unphysical negative salinity. In practice, this situation is rare, but it is a safety measure against extreme scenarios (eg, rapid freezing in nearly fresh water). We also set `SALINITY_UNDERFLOW = 0.0`, meaning any tiny salinity values (close to 0) are reset to exactly 0 as well.

Another parameter we adjust is `HFREEZE = 10.0`. This means the model comoputes a "melt potential" over a `10m` layer for sea-ice melt/freeze processes. If `HFREEZE >0`, the ocean will calculate how much heat is available in the top 10 meters to melt ice. 

### Sea surface forcing
The current configuration is forced with repeating atmospheric conditions and includes weak surface restoring for salinity. We use a repeat-year forcing (RYF) strategy with the JRA55-do dataset. This means the model experiences one year of normal seasonal cycle atmospheric fluxes (wind, heat, precipitation, etc) that is repeated every model year. The advantages are avoiding interannual variability while maintaining a realistic seasonal cycle, helping to equilibrate the ocean state. More details can be found in [Forcing data models](pages/forcing-data-models/).

### Surface salinity restoring
We use `RESTORE_SALINITY = True` to have sea surface salinity (`SSS`) is weakly restored to a reference field (`SALT_RESTORE_FILE = "salt_sfc_restore.nc"`), and a piston velocity (`FLUXCONST = 0.11`m/day) is given. The restoring is implemented as a virtual salt flux ( `SRESTORE_AS_SFLUX = True`) to nudge `SSS`. This approach conserves salt overall (balanced globally by subtracting the mean flux, because we set `ADJUST_NET_SRESTORE_TO_ZERO = True` to avoid altering global salinity). `MAX_DELTA_SRESTORE = 999` hence currently there’s effectively no cap on the SSS anomaly used.
