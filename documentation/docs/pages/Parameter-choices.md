## MOM6 parameter choices

### Horizontal grid

The 25km global configuration uses a tripolar grid to avoid a singularity at the North Pole. The domain is zonally periodic `REENTRANT_X = True` and open at the north via a tripolar fold `TRIPOLAR_N = True` while closed in the south `REENTRANT_Y = False`. The horizontal grid has `1440x1142` tracer points. This matches the resolution of prior models (eg, ACCESS-OM2-025 and GFDL OM4/OM5) and provides eddy-permitting detail in the ocean while maintaining numerical stability.

### Vertical resolution and ALE coordinate
The current configuration uses 75 vertical layers (`NK=75`) with an arbitrary Lagrangian Euler (`ALE`) vertical coordinate scheme. The ALE scheme is enabled by `USE_REGRIDDING = True` (activating the “split-explicit” layered/reegridding algorithm). Rather than fixed z-levels, MOM6 can operate in a hybrid vertical coordinate mode. The current configuration uses a stretched $z^*$ vertical coordinate `REGRIDDING_COORDINATE_MODE = "ZSTAR"`. The vertical grid spacing is specified via an input file (`ALE_COORDINATE_CONFIG = "FILE:ocean_vgrid.nc,interfaces=zeta"`). The deepest ocean depth is set to `MAXIMUM_DEPTH = 6000.0` and partial bottom cells are effectively used by `ALE`. Gravitational acceleration (`G_EARTH = 9.8`) and reference density (`RHO_0 = 1035`) are set to standard values, consistent with `BOUSSINESQ = True`. The Boussinesq setup means density variations only affect buoyancy, not total mass. In our configuration, sea level is computed assuming a reference density (here using the fixed reference density for sea-level calc since `CALC_RHO_FOR_SEA_LEVEL = False`).

### Thermodynamics and Equation of State (TEOS-10)
The current configuration uses `EQN_OF_STATE = "ROQUET_RHO"` for seawater, which refers to the polynomial fit of the `TEOS-10` equation of state by [@roquet2015accurate]. [`ROQUET_RHO`](<https://mom6.readthedocs.io/en/main/api/generated/pages/Equation_of_State.html#:~:text=in%20situ%20temperature).-,ROQUET_RHO%20Equation%20of%20State,-%C2%B6>) uses a 75-term polynomial to compute in-situ density as a function of conservative temperature and absolute salinity (`USE_CONTEMP_ABSSAL = True`), closely approximating the full TEOS-10 results. However, the cold-start initial conditions in our configuration use an inconsistent temperature–salinity pair - specifically, conservative temperature combined with practical salinity (see [issues/235](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues/235)). 

The `_RHO` variant specifically fits density rather than specific volume, ideal for layered models and ensuring that neutral density calculations are precise. The configuration also sets the freezing point formulation to `TFREEZE_FORM = "TEOS_POLY"`, indicating the model computes the seawater freezing temperature with a [TEOS-10](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/nwprod/hafs.v2.0.8/sorc/hafs_forecast.fd/MOM6-interface/MOM6/src/equation_of_state/_Equation_of_State.dox#:~:text=This%20one%20or%0ATEOS_poly%20must%20be%20used%20if%20you%20are%20using%20the%20ROQUET_RHO%2C%20ROQUET_SPV%20or%20TEOS%2D10%0Aequation%20of%20state.).
