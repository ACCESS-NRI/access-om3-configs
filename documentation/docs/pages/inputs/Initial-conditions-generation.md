# Generating MOM6 Initial Conditions Using WOA23 dataset

This guide outlines the steps to generate **conservative temperature** and **salinity** fields for MOM6 using **World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23)** data, suitable for ACCESS-OM3 simulations.

## Repository and Requirements

Clone the repository that includes all necessary tools and submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/initial_conditions_access-om3.git
cd initial_conditions_access-om3
```

A recursive clone is needed because this repository includes Nic Hannahâ€™s [ocean-ic](https://github.com/COSIMA/ocean-ic) code as a submodule, used to interpolate WOA23 data onto MOM6 3D grids.

## Step 1: (Optional) Regenerate Temperature & Salinity from Raw WOA23

Use this step **only** if you want to regenerate T/S fields from a **different version** of World Ocean Atlas dataset.

```
./inte.csh
```

The `inte.csh` script processes World Ocean Atlas 2023 (WOA23) data to create consistent monthly temperature and salinity fields suitable for generating MOM6 initial conditions.

### Purpose

By default, WOA23 provides:
- Full-depth **annual mean** data (`XX = 00`)
- **Monthly** data (`XX = 01â€“12`) only for the **upper 1500â€¯m**
- **Seasonal** data (`XX = 13â€“16`) covering **full depth**

To use full-depth data with **monthly resolution**, `inte.csh` reconstructs it by combining seasonal deep data with monthly shallow data. The WOA23 dataset is based on oceanographic observations collected over the period 1955 to 2022.

### What the Script Does

1. **Extract salinity (`s_an`)** from seasonal full-depth data and expand it to monthly resolution.
2. Use `ncks --mk_rec time` to add an unlimited time dimension to make the NetCDF files record-aware.
3. **Rename the salinity variable** from `s_an` to `practical_salinity` for compatibility with the processing pipeline.
4. Run `setup_WOA_initial_conditions.py` to combine monthly upper ocean and seasonal lower ocean data, then convert WOA23 in-situ temperature to conservative temperature.

The processed monthly files are output to:
```
/g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om3/woa23/monthly
```

> ðŸ’¡ You only need to run this script if you're updating or modifying the WOA23 dataset. Otherwise, skip this step and proceed directly to regridding using `make_initial_conditions.sh`.

---

## Step 2: Regrid to MOM6 Grid

Use the regridding script to interpolate WOA23 temperature and salinity to your MOM6 model grid.

```
cd initial_conditions_WOA/
qsub -v VGRID="<path_to_vgrid_file>",HGRID="<path_to_hgrid_file>",INPUT_DIR="<path_to_input_directory>",OUTPUT_DIR="<path_to_output_directory>" -P $PROJECT make_initial_conditions.sh
```

Replace the variables with your grid and directory paths:
- `VGRID`: MOM6 vertical grid file
- `HGRID`: MOM6 horizontal grid file
- `INPUT_DIR`: Directory with processed WOA23 monthly files
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Where regridded output will be saved

> Note: This code is not parallelized and may take approximately 24 hours to run for the 25km (0.25Â°) resolution grid.
---

## Step 3: Finalize & Tag Metadata

Once satisfied with the output, run:

```
./finalise.sh -o /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om3/woa23/025/
```

This:
- Commits any changes with `git`
- Adds Git metadata to the NetCDF metadata

---

##  Notes

- Make sure to adjust paths in `inte.csh` if you change the WOA23 dataset.
- You can repeat Step 2 to generate initial conditions for any resolution. Step 1 is agnostic of the model resolution as the data is on the WOA23 grid.
