# Forcing

Forcing is provided via [CDEPS](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CDEPS) data models [documented here](https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/versions/master/html/index.html), in particular

- [DATM](https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/versions/master/html/datm.html) for the atmosphere
- [DROF](https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/versions/master/html/drof.html) for runoff

## Coupling

- DATM and DROF are coupled to the other components via the mediator - see the [coupling architecture here](Architecture.md).
- The coupled fields and remapping methods used are recorded in the mediator log output file and can be found with `grep '^ mapping' archive/output000/log/med.log`; see [here](https://escomp.github.io/CMEPS/versions/master/html/esmflds.html) for how to decode this.
- See [the Configurations Overview page](configurations/Overview.md#coupling) for details on how the coupling is determined.

## Input data

[JRA55do v1.6](https://climate.mri-jma.go.jp/pub/ocean/JRA55-do/), [replicated by NCI](https://dx.doi.org/10.25914/AT4E-Q668), is used as input data for DATM and DROF, following convention used in OMIP2 and drafted for OMIP3. For interannual-forcing (IAF) experiments, this data is available from 1958 until January 2024. For repeat-year-forcing (RYF) experiments, a single year of atmosphere and runoff data is selected (Jan-Apr 1991 and May-Dec 1990) using the `make_ryf.py` script in [om3-scripts](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/om3-scripts/blob/main/make_ryf/make_ryf.py) to generate the input files. This input data is repeated to produce the same input forcing in every model year. _Stewart et al._ (2020) describe the selected 12-month period to be one of the most neutral across the major climate modes of variability and less affected by the anthropogenic warming found in later years of the dataset. The paper does however remind us that the resulting model is an idealised numerical experiments and not a representation of long-term climatology.

[`datm.streams.xml`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/blob/dev-MC_100km_jra_ryf/datm.streams.xml) and [`drof.streams.xml`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/blob/dev-MC_100km_jra_ryf/drof.streams.xml) set individual input file paths for DATM and DROF respectively, relative to [this entry](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AACCESS-NRI%2Faccess-om3-configs+path%3Adoc%2Fconfig.yaml+%22RYF%2Fv%22&type=code) in the `input` section of [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/blob/dev-MC_100km_jra_ryf/config.yaml) (see [the Configurations Overview page](configurations/Overview.md#forcing-data)). These stream files also set time and spatial interpolation, time axes and ranges 

### Atmosphere

JRA55-do atmosphere provides **3-hourly instantenous**:

- sea level pressure;
- 10m wind velocity components;
- 10m specific humidity;
- 10m air temperature.

and **3-hourly averaged**:

- liquid and solid precipitation;
- downwelling surface long-wave and shortwave radiation. 

Input data is first remapped from DATM to the mediator, and second from the mediator to the ocean (MOM6). The first step remaps from the source grid (~55km resolution) to the access-om3 grid using bilinear interpolation spatially, and linear interpolation in time (except for downwelling shortwave, which uses "coszen" interpolation in time - _cosine of the solar zenith angle_). Weights for this first remapping are calculated automatically during model initialisation. The second stage remapping moves from the om3 grid without a landmask to the same grid with a landmask. For atmosphere forcing, the landmask is applied simply as a true/false mask, as access-om3 does not have partial ocean cells. This results in only the states and fluxes over the ocean being input as forcings.

### Runoff

JRA55-do runoff provides 12-hourly averaged liquid and frozen runoff fields, although the runoff at many locations in the dataset is updated less frequently than 12-hourly. In the source data, all frozen run-off is distributed at the ocean surface of the Antarctic/Greenland coastlines without spreading (see [404](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues/404)). 

Similar to atmsophere forcing, runoff data is first remapped from DROF to the mediator, and second from the mediator the the ocean (MOM6). The first mapping step is similar to the atmospheric forcing, namely using bilinear interpolation spatially and linear interpolation in time. The second stage remapping moves from the om3 grid without a landmask to the same grid with a landmask. For runoff, the differences in landmask between the incoming data on the JRA grid and the om3-grids can cause runoff to be remapped to land cells. When runoff would be placed on land cells, the volume of runoff is crudely moved to the nearest ocean cell using pre-generated weights from the [generate_rof_weights.py](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/om3-scripts/blob/main/mesh_generation/generate_rof_weights.py) script. _generate_rof_weights.py_ selects the nearest ocean cell by a BallTree algorithm using Haversine distances (i.e. the shortest disance on a sphere). The combined effect of the two remapping steps is that the full global volume of runoff enters the ocean.


## Ice surface wind stress

This is calculated in CICE6 (IcePack). The wind velocity, specific humidity, air density and potential temperature at the level height `zlvl` (with optionally a different height `zlvs` for scalars) are used to compute transfer coefficients used in formulas for the surface wind stress and turbulent heat fluxes.

The CICE6 forcing settings are in [namelist group `forcing_nml` in `cice_in`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AACCESS-NRI%2Faccess-om3-configs+path%3Adoc%2Fice_in+forcing_nml&type=code). Many are unspecified and therefore take the [default values](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/cice6.4.0/user_guide/ug_case_settings.html#forcing-nml).
We use the default [`atmbndy = 'similarity'`](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/cice6.4.0/user_guide/ug_case_settings.html?highlight=atmbndy#forcing-nml), which uses a [stability-based boundary layer parameterisation based on Monin-Obukhov theory](https://cice-consortium-icepack.readthedocs.io/en/main/science_guide/sg_boundary_forcing.html#atmosphere) following [Kauffman and Large (2002)](https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE/blob/main/doc/PDF/KL_NCAR2002.pdf).
Because our ice-ocean coupling frequency resolves inertial oscillations we use the non-default option [`highfreq = .true.`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AACCESS-NRI%2Faccess-om3-configs+path%3Adoc%2Fice_in+highfreq&type=code) ([Roberts et al., 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2015AoG69A760)), which uses the relative ice-atmosphere velocity to calculate the wind stress on the ice.
The exchange coefficients for momentum and scalars are determined iteratively, with a convergence tolerance `atmiter_conv` on `ustar` and maximum `natmiter` iterations. These take [default values](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/cice6.4.0/user_guide/ug_case_settings.html#forcing-nml) `atmiter_conv = 0.0` and `natmiter = 5`. We don't use [spatiotemporally variable form drag](https://cice-consortium-icepack.readthedocs.io/en/main/science_guide/sg_boundary_forcing.html#variable-exchange-coefficients) (`formdrag = .false`, the [default](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/cice6.4.0/user_guide/ug_case_settings.html#forcing-nml)).

Ocean surface stress is a combination of wind stress and ice-ocean stress.
`Foxx_taux` and `Foxx_tauy` are the components of this combined surface stress [received by the MOM6 cap](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/MOM6/blob/776be843e904d85c7035ffa00233b962a03bfbb4/config_src/drivers/nuopc_cap/mom_cap_methods.F90#L149-L154), and are [calculated in the mediator](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CMEPS/blob/4b636c6f794ca02d854d15c620e26644751b449b/mediator/esmFldsExchange_cesm_mod.F90#L2242-L2274).
`Foxx_taux` is a weighted sum of `Fioi_taux` (the ice-ocean stress) and `Faox_taux` (the atmosphere-ocean stress), weighted by the fraction of ice and open ocean in each cell. Similarly, `Foxx_tauy` is a weighted sum of `Fioi_tauy` and `Faox_tauy`. The prefix `Foxx` denotes an ocean (`o`) - mediator (`x`) flux (`F`) calculated by the mediator (`x`). Similarly `Fioi` denotes an ice (`i`) - ocean flux calculated by the ice component, and `Faox` indicates an atmosphere (`a`) - ocean flux calculated by the mediator (see [here](https://escomp.github.io/CMEPS/versions/master/html/esmflds.html) for details on this notation).
Thus `Fioi_taux` is calculated in CICE6, whereas `Faox_taux` is calculated in the mediator (similarly for the y components).

### Ice-ocean stress

The ice-ocean stress components `Fioi_taux` and `Fioi_tauy` are calculated in CICE6.
`Fioi_taux` and `Fioi_tauy` are [mapped from `tauxo` and `tauyo` in the CICE6 cap](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/CICE/blob/e68e05b7962fc926c8a35397bca464d6b1e06ab9/cicecore/drivers/nuopc/cmeps/ice_import_export.F90#L1253-L1261), which are in turn [calculated in the CICE6 cap from `strocnxT_iavg` and `strocnyT_iavg`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/CICE/blob/e68e05b7962fc926c8a35397bca464d6b1e06ab9/cicecore/drivers/nuopc/cmeps/ice_import_export.F90#L1011-L1014), which are per-ice-area quantities at T points [calculated from per-cell-area stresses at U points `strocnxU` and `strocnyU`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/CICE/blob/e68e05b7962fc926c8a35397bca464d6b1e06ab9/cicecore/cicedyn/general/ice_step_mod.F90#L977-L1007).
`strocnxU` and `strocnyU` are calculated by [subtroutine `dyn_finish`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/CICE/blob/e68e05b7962fc926c8a35397bca464d6b1e06ab9/cicecore/cicedyn/dynamics/ice_dyn_evp.F90#L1384-L1398) using [this code](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/CICE/blob/e68e05b7962fc926c8a35397bca464d6b1e06ab9/cicecore/cicedyn/dynamics/ice_dyn_shared.F90#L1291-L1316); see [equation (4) here](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/main/science_guide/sg_coupling.html#equation-tauw) and [equation (2) here](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/cice6.4.0/science_guide/sg_dynamics.html) for an explanation. We use a turning angle $\theta=0$ (`cosw = 1.0`, `sinw = 0.0`, the [defaults](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/main/cice_index.html)), which is appropriate for an ocean component with vertical resolution sufficient to resolve the surface Ekman layer. We don't use [spatiotemporally variable form drag](https://cice-consortium-icepack.readthedocs.io/en/main/science_guide/sg_boundary_forcing.html#variable-exchange-coefficients) (`formdrag = .false`, the [default](https://cice-consortium-cice.readthedocs.io/en/cice6.4.0/user_guide/ug_case_settings.html#forcing-nml)).

**TODO: what namelist controls the ice-ocean stress calculation?**  

### Atmosphere-ocean stress
The atmosphere-ocean stress components `Faox_taux` and `Faox_tauy` are [calculated in the mediator](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CMEPS/blob/bc29792d76c16911046dbbfcfc7f4c3ae89a6f00/cesm/flux_atmocn/shr_flux_mod.F90#L434-L438).
We calculate `Faox_taux` and `Faox_tauy` using [`ocn_surface_flux_scheme = 0`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AACCESS-NRI%2Faccess-om3-configs+path%3Adoc%2Fnuopc.runconfig+ocn_surface_flux_scheme&type=code) in `nuopc.runconfig`, which is the [default CESM1.2 scheme](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CMEPS/blob/bc29792d76c16911046dbbfcfc7f4c3ae89a6f00/cesm/flux_atmocn/shr_flux_mod.F90#L335-L506).
This [iterates towards convergence of `ustar`](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CMEPS/blob/bc29792d76c16911046dbbfcfc7f4c3ae89a6f00/cesm/flux_atmocn/shr_flux_mod.F90#L393) to a relative error of less than [`flux_convergence = 0.01`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AACCESS-NRI%2Faccess-om3-configs+path%3Adoc%2Fnuopc.runconfig+flux_convergence&type=code), if this can be achieved in [`flux_max_iteration = 5`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AACCESS-NRI%2Faccess-om3-configs+path%3Adoc%2Fnuopc.runconfig+flux_max_iteration&type=code) iterations or fewer. The atmosphere-ocean stress is [calculated using the relative wind](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CMEPS/blob/bc29792d76c16911046dbbfcfc7f4c3ae89a6f00/cesm/flux_atmocn/shr_flux_mod.F90#L434-L438), i.e. the difference between the surface wind and surface current velocity.
