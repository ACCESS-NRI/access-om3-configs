## Getting involved in ACCESS-OM3

There are several ways we welcome feedback and contributions on ACCESS-OM3 development. **Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged.** All the models and configurations we develop are open source. Development is led by ACCESS-NRI and the [COSIMA working group](https://cosima.org.au/) where we follow an open development model building on the work of international modelling consortia.

### Interact with developers in person

If you would like to interact in person with [the development team](https://www.access-nri.org.au/ocean-model-team/), we have fortnightly technical working group meetings on Wednesdays at 3pm. They are announced [on the access hive forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/cosima-twg-announce/401/69) (subscribe to this thread for notifications) and the meeting minutes are [in the TWG category](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cosima/twg/39). Everyone is welcome to suggest agenda items and participate.

We also have an active and vibrant user community: [the COSIMA working group](https://cosima.org.au/). They have meetings on Thursday at 11:30am that are announced in [this access hive forum topic](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/cosima-working-group-announce/238/156). More information about getting involved is [here](https://cosima.org.au/index.php/get-involved/).

We also manage most of our development openly on GitHub and track ACCESS-OM3 work on a [GitHub project board here](https://github.com/orgs/ACCESS-NRI/projects/24). If you'd like to have your issue considered for ACCESS-OM3 development, please [open an issue and add it to the project board using this template](https://github.com/access-nri/access-om3-configs/issues/new?template=osit-issue-template-for-om3-work---project-board.md).

### Help us evaluate and improve applications of OM3 

We have a community based group the "ACCESS-OM3 model evaluation team" that are helping with OM3 evaluation and development. Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged. To join the meetings follow the announcements [here](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/access-om3-model-evaluation-team-announce/4476).

All community members (and ACCESS-NRI staff) can get [write access to the OM3 evaluation repository](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-paper-1/). To get write access, you need to create an issue and request access, [please use this issue template](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-paper-1/issues/new?template=add-user-request-to--access-om3-paper-1--repository-.md). Evaluation figures are being coordinated [here](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-paper-1/issues/23). Instructions to get started are [here](https://github.com/ACCESS-Community-Hub/access-om3-paper-1/blob/main/README.md).
