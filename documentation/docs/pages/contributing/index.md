## Getting involved in ACCESS-OM3

There are several ways we welcome feedback and contributions on ACCESS-OM3 development. **Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds are highly encouraged.** All the models and configurations we develop are open source. Development is led by ACCESS-NRI and the [COSIMA working group](https://cosima.org.au/) where we follow an open development model building on the work of international modelling consortia.

### Interact with developers in person

If you would like to interact in person with [the development team](https://www.access-nri.org.au/ocean-model-team/), we have fortnightly technical working group meetings on Wednesdays at 3pm. They are announced [on the access hive forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/cosima-twg-announce/401/69) (subscribe to this thread for notifications) and the meeting minutes are [in the TWG category](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cosima/twg/39). Everyone is welcome to suggest agenda items and participate.

We also have an active and vibrant user community: [the COSIMA working group](https://cosima.org.au/). They have meetings on Thursday at 11:30am that are announced in [this access hive forum topic](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/cosima-working-group-announce/238/156). More information about getting involved is [here](https://cosima.org.au/index.php/get-involved/).

We also manage most of our development openly on GitHub and track ACCESS-OM3 work on a [GitHub project board here](https://github.com/orgs/ACCESS-NRI/projects/24). If you'd like to have your issue considered for ACCESS-OM3 development, please [open an issue and add it to the project board using this template](https://github.com/access-nri/access-om3-configs/issues/new?template=osit-issue-template-for-om3-work---project-board.md).
