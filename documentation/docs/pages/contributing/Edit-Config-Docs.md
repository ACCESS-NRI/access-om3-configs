## ACCESS-OM3-configs documentation contributions welcome üôè
This documentation is a work in progress, and we welcome any contributions, including corrections and suggestions.

All contributions are welcome but we would particularly appreciate text suggestions (below). Contributions can be made in a few ways:

### Quick contributions 
!!! tip
    This method has the advantage is that it's *very quick* (<1 minute!). The caveat is that, unless you have write access to the `access-om3-configs` repository, you will not be able to preview the changes rendered into a website or create whole new pages. <br>

The simplest and fastest way to make a change to an _existing_ page is to click the edit "pencil" on the top-right corner. This will go to the relevant GitHub markdown file and clicking the top-right pencil again on GitHub will allow you to edit the file. Once complete, click `Commit changes...`. There are then _two_ possibilities, depending on whether you have  write access to [`access-om3-configs`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs): 

1.  **No write access** (e.g. you are not part of the `ACCESS-NRI` GitHub organisation): this will prompt you to make a fork and then a pull request (less than 1 minute!). 
1.  **You have write access**: please commit changes on a new branch and then use a pull request (this relates to the next option). 

### Larger contributions (online PR-previews)
!!! tip
    This method allows you create whole new pages, and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It does not require you to install any software, but is **only available for people with write access to [`access-om3-configs`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs)**.<br>

Create a new branch, e.g. `jblogs/doc-update`, make doc changes (the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation)), then open a related PR and a GitHub preview will be made automatically.

### Larger contributions (`mkdocs` offline)
!!! tip
    Similar to the above, this method allows you create whole new pages and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It works whether or not you have write access to [`access-om3-configs`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs), but requires you to install `mkdocs` and takes the longest to set up.<br>

Following [these instructions](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) but noting the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation). You'll need to fork and clone [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs) if you want to [write your own content](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) (`mkdocs serve` should be invoked from within the `documentation` directory).
