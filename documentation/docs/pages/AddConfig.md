## Adding a new configuration to ACCESS-OM3 configs

### Scope
We need to produce protocol and guidance on how to include a regional configuration as a supported configuration. Including regional configurations will require ongoing upkeep. We want a protocol that identifies candidate regional mom6 configurations (for inclusion as a supported config) that minimises the upkeep overhead whist meeting a community need.

## Community interest criteria

 - Ease of support (where possible needs to be aligned with existing X configuration or support is limited). A patch file to apply community differences could be supplied (e.g. override file)?

## Support

 - Length of time we provide support / updates for

## OSIT thoughts
 - If they have submitted data to intake/shared data?
 - an ACCESS-NRI executable
 - input files with provenance (e.g. metadata that help you make the file)
 - community interest/engagement in the application
 - doc description of what they are providing (stubby system)
