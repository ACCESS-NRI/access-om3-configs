## Getting involved in ACCESS-OM3

There are several ways we welcome feedback and contributions on ACCESS-OM3 development. Contributions from people of all career stages and backgrounds is highly encouraged. All the models and configurations we develop are open source. Development is led by ACCESS-NRI and the [COSIMA working group](https://cosima.org.au/) where we follow an open development model building on the work of international modelling consortia.

### Interact with developers in person

If you would like to interact in person with [the development team](https://www.access-nri.org.au/ocean-model-team/), we have fortnightly technical working group meetings on Wednesdays at 3pm. They are announced [on the access hive forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/cosima-twg-announce/401/69) (subscribe to this thread for notifications) and the meeting minutes are [in the TWG category](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cosima/twg/39). Everyone is welcome to suggest agenda items and participate.

We also have an active and vibrant user community: [the COSIMA working group](https://cosima.org.au/). They have meetings on Thursday at 11:30am. Announced [here](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/cosima-working-group-announce/238/156). More information about getting involved is [here](https://cosima.org.au/index.php/get-involved/).

We also manage most of our development openly on GitHub, we track OM3 work on a [GitHub project board here](https://github.com/orgs/ACCESS-NRI/projects/24). If you'd like to have your issue considered for OM3 development, please [open an issue and add it to the project board using this template](https://github.com/access-nri/access-om3-configs/issues/new?template=osit-issue-template-for-om3-work---project-board.md).

### Report a bug or make a suggestion

Technical issues related to OM3 are best posted to [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues). If you would like to discuss the issue first, feel free to post it on the [ACCESS-HIVE forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cosima/29).

### How to add a community supported ACCESS-OM3 configuration documentation
We provide protocol and guidance on how apply to have your regional configuration supported by ACCESS-NRI. More details to be added soon (@helenmacdonald ; https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/pull/574)

### Contribute to one of ACCESS-OM3's components

There are several different ways to do this depending on the kind of contribution and the component. Best to get in touch on the [ACCESS-HIVE forum](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/c/cosima/29) or email chris.bull@anu.edu.au.

## ACCESS-OM3-configs documentation contributions welcome üôè
This documentation is a work in progress, and we welcome any contributions, including corrections and suggestions.

All contributions are welcome but we would particularly appreciate text suggestions (below). Contributions can be made in a few ways:

### Quick contributions 
!!! tip
    This method has the advantage is that it's *very quick* (<1 minute!). The caveat is that, unless you have write access to the `access-om3-configs` repository, you will not be able to preview the changes rendered into a website or create whole new pages. <br>

The simplest and fastest way to make a change to an _existing_ page is to click the edit "pencil" on the top-right corner. This will go to the relevant GitHub markdown file and clicking the top-right pencil again on GitHub will allow you to edit the file. Once complete, click `Commit changes...`. There are then _two_ possibilities, depending on whether you have  write access to [`access-om3-configs`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs): 

1.  **No write access** (e.g. you are not part of the `ACCESS-NRI` GitHub organisation): this will prompt you to make a fork and then a pull request (less than 1 minute!). 
1.  **You have write access**: please commit changes on a new branch and then use a pull request (this relates to the next option). 

### Larger contributions (online PR-previews)
!!! tip
    This method allows you create whole new pages, and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It does not require you to install any software, but is **only available for people with write access to [`access-om3-configs`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs)**.<br>

Create a new branch, e.g. `jblogs/doc-update`, make doc changes (the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation)), then open a related PR and a GitHub preview will be made automatically.

### Larger contributions (`mkdocs` offline)
!!! tip
    Similar to the above, this method allows you create whole new pages and to preview the changes rendered into a website. It works whether or not you have write access to [`access-om3-configs`](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs), but requires you to install `mkdocs` and takes the longest to set up.<br>

Following [these instructions](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) but noting the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation). You'll need to fork and clone [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs) if you want to [write your own content](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) (`mkdocs serve` should be invoked from within the `documentation` directory).
