Welcome to the documentation for the [ACCESS-OM3 global ice-ocean model configurations](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs)!

See the links on the left, particularly the [quick start](pages/Quick-start.md).

## Contributions welcome üôè
This documentation is a work in progress, and we welcome any contributions, including corrections and suggestions.

Contributions can be made in a few ways.

## Report a bug or make a suggestion
Issues should be posted to [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues). All contributions are welcome but we would particularly apprecaite text suggestions (below).

## Quick contributions 
!!! tip
    For external people, this method does not allow one to preview the changes rendered into a website or create whole new pages. It's advantage is that it's *very quick* to do.<br>
    For people with write and without write access to `ACCESS-OM3-CONFIGS`.<br>

If a change is being made to an existing page, then the simplest and fastest way to make a change is to click the edit "pencil" on the top-right corner of each rendered page. This will go to the relevant GitHub markdown file and clicking the top-right pencil again on GitHub will allow one to edit the file. Once complete click `Commit changes...`. There are then _two_ possibilities, depending on whether you have  write access to `ACCESS-OM3-CONFIGS`: 

1.  **No write access** (e.g. you are not part of the `ACCESS-NRI` GitHub organisation): this will prompt one to make a fork and then pull request (less than 1 minute!). 
1.  **You have write access**: please commit changes on a new branch and then use a pull request (this relates to the next option). 

## Larger contributions using online PR-previews
!!! tip
    This method does allow one to preview the changes rendered into a website and create whole new pages. It does not require one to install any software.<br>
    Only for people with write access to `ACCESS-OM3-CONFIGS`.<br>

Create a new branch, e.g. `jblogs/doc-update` make doc changes (the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation)), then open a related PR and a GitHub preview will be made automatically.

## Larger contributions (offline)
!!! tip
    This method does allow one to preview the changes rendered into a website and create whole new pages. It requires one to install mkdocs and takes the longest to set up.<br>
    For people with write and without write access to `ACCESS-OM3-CONFIGS`.<br>

Following [these instructions](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) but noting the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation). You'll need to fork and clone [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs) if you want to [write your own content](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) (`mkdocs serve` should be invoked from within the `documentation` directory).
