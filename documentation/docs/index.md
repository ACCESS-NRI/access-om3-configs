Welcome to the documentation for the [ACCESS-OM3 global ice-ocean model configurations](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs)!

See the links on the left, particularly the [quick start](pages/Quick-start.md).

## Contributions welcome üôè
This documentation is a work in progress, and we welcome any contributions, including corrections and suggestions.

Contributions can be made following [these instructions](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/), but note that the documentation sources are in [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/tree/main/documentation), so issues should be posted to [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs/issues), not https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-hive.org.au/issues. Similarly, you'll need to fork and clone [github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om3-configs) if you want to [write your own content](https://docs.access-hive.org.au/about/contribute/contribute_on_github/) (`mkdocs serve` should be invoked from within the `documentation` directory).
