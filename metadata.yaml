  25km ACCESS-OM3 global configuration under the RYF9091 Repeat
  Year Forcing strategy outlined by Stewart et al (2020), 
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101557.
  Initial conditions are WOA23 potential temperature and practical salinity.
  Run with JRA55-do v1.6.0 RYF9091 (1 May 1990 - 30 April 1991) repeated forcing.
  Spin up starts from a nominal year of 1 Jan 1900.
