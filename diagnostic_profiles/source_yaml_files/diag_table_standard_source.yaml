# diag_table section - this defines the diagnostics that will appear in diag_table.
# 
# Top-level categories in diag_table have arbitrary names (they're just used for
# comments in the output diag_table). Make as many of these as you like to group
# similar diagnostics with shared defaults. Note that each of the top-level
# categories can have only have one instance of each field name, so if you need
# multiple outputs of the same field (e.g. as both averages and snapshots), youâ€™ll
# need to make additional categories.
# 
# Within each top-level category there's an optional defaults section and a
# fields section. The defaults section overrides items in global_defaults for
# all fields in the category. The field section specifies diagnostic field
# names. To add a new diagnostic, all you need to do is add its name to the
# field section in the appropriate category. Each field name can be followed by
# a dictionary overriding the category and global defaults for that field only.
# 
# Some of the available diagnostics are listed here:
