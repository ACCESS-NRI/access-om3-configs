MASKTABLE = mask_table.2.10x10 ! default = "MOM_mask_table"
                                ! A text file to specify n_mask, layout and mask_list. This feature masks out
                                ! processors that contain only land points. The first line of mask_table is the
                                ! number of regions to be masked out. The second line is the layout of the model
                                ! and must be consistent with the actual model layout. The following (n_mask)
                                ! lines give the logical positions of the processors that are masked out. The
                                ! mask_table can be created by tools like check_mask. The following example of
                                ! mask_table masks out 2 processors, (1,2) and (3,6), out of the 24 in a 4x6

LAYOUT = 10,10                 !
                                ! The processor layout that was actually used.
IO_LAYOUT = 1, 1                ! default = 1
                                ! The processor layout to be used, or 0,0 to automatically set the io_layout to
                                ! be the same as the layout.
